# latticed development listener

`latticed` now adapts the sans-I/O PostgreSQL session to TCP. The placeholder handler answers
`SELECT 1`; other SQL returns `0A000`. Simple and extended query framing are handled by the existing
session. The default is explicit development trust on loopback. Configured SCRAM mode requires
TLS and refuses plaintext startup or trust fallback. It does not open a database or establish the
five-driver matrix. CancelRequest routes a cooperative token and cannot preempt blocking I/O.

```sh
cargo run -p latticed -- --auth development-trust --listen 127.0.0.1:5432 --max-connections 32
```

The default address is `127.0.0.1:5432`. Read and write timeouts default to 30 seconds and 5 seconds;
set `--read-timeout-ms` and `--write-timeout-ms` to change them. A read timeout covers a complete
frame, including fragmented or slowly supplied headers and bodies. The existing codec's 1 MiB
message limit is checked before allocating a frame body. The configured count must be 1–1024 and
bounds registered SQL sessions. An excess SQL startup receives `53300` after its packet is classified.
Eight additional transport workers allow CancelRequest and startup packets to be read at that cap;
the total worker bound is the configured count plus eight. At that absolute bound new transports
close without a reply. Flooding the extra slots can still prevent cancellation from being admitted.

Type `shutdown` followed by a newline on stdin to stop cleanly. EOF on stdin also stops the process;
a supervisor must keep that control channel open while serving. This control mechanism does not
install signal handlers. Embedders can call `ServerHandle::shutdown`; dropping the handle also stops
the listener, interrupts active socket reads/writes and joins all connection workers.

Each accepted connection has one host thread. Protocol logic remains in `lattice-api`; socket I/O,
thread lifecycle and admission limits stay in this composition crate. Socket tests independently
encode their expected messages and cover fragmentation, pipelining, connection admission, timeouts,
malformed lengths and shutdown. No phase or driver-conformance gate is established by this adapter.


## Cooperative cancellation

Each admitted SQL connection receives a registry-generated `BackendKeyData` pair. A separate
CancelRequest connection checks both fields, signals the current query and closes without a reply;
unknown and stale keys have the same no-reply behavior. Keys live for the whole connection and are
unregistered on termination, disconnect or worker unwind. The host uses explicit logical time zero
and maximum lifetime in the registry rather than expiring a still-open client's only credential.
Registry PIDs are not reused during this server lifetime.

`ServerHandle::start_with_handler` creates a handler per admitted connection. The host always drives
`Session::on_message_with_cancellation` and allocates a fresh token for Query, Parse and Execute.
Handlers that override `execute_cancellable` or `describe_cancellable` must poll the token between
bounded work units and choose their abort/commit boundary. Returning `57014` gives the normal query
error flow; extended errors discard messages until Sync, and an active transaction remains failed
until rollback. A portal cancelled before execution cannot resume; cached successful results remain readable. Idle cancellation does not poison the next query.

Legacy handler methods remain usable: their default cancellation-aware methods check before entry,
but they cannot preempt a handler that blocks without polling. Successful possibly-committed results
are never relabeled as cancellation after return, and already-computed result transmission is not
interrupted. No real SQL executor, statement rollback implementation or driver conformance is claimed.
Shutdown atomically closes admission and new query-token allocation while signalling all registered
tokens, closes sockets and then joins workers; cooperative handlers
can exit promptly. Registry poison causes normal operations to fail closed, while shutdown and
unregister recover the lock only to cancel/clean up safely.

## Configured SCRAM over TLS (proposed integration)

```sh
cargo run -p latticed -- --auth scram-tls --listen 127.0.0.1:5432 \
  --tls-cert /secure/server-chain.pem --tls-key /secure/server-key.pem \
  --scram-verifiers /secure/accounts.txt --scram-decoy-secret /secure/decoy-secret.bin \
  --startup-timeout-ms 10000
```

Provision those files externally. The decoy-secret file is mandatory and must contain exactly 32
cryptographically random binary bytes (not hex/Base64 text or a trailing newline). Generate it once
with an operating-system cryptographic RNG, restrict access like the verifier file, and persist the
same file across reloads/restarts and instances serving the same account set. The listener never
generates a replacement on load. Back up and restore it together with credential configuration;
changing it changes unknown-account salts and can reveal account existence to observers comparing
challenges across rotation. Rotation/compromise requires a separate operational policy and is not
claimed unobservable. The credential file has one `username<TAB>verifier` per line:
`SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:base64-salt$base64-stored-key:base64-server-key`. Only the uniform 4096-iteration,
16-byte-salt profile is accepted; keys are 32 bytes, names at most 63 UTF-8 bytes without controls,
and files at most 256 KiB/1024 accounts. There is no plaintext password flag, embedded account,
password derivation on the network path or credential-file persistence API. Protect file permissions
and prepare passwords during external provisioning; SASLprep is outside this listener.

Clients must use certificate verification, including the intended server name (for example libpq
`sslmode=verify-full` with a trusted CA). Standard SSLRequest upgrades to TLS 1.2/1.3; SCRAM never
runs over plaintext. Trust refuses non-loopback binds. Certificate/key validation happens before bind.
No mutual TLS, direct TLS startup, SCRAM-PLUS, channel binding or certificate rotation is implemented.

A single deadline covers TCP accept, startup negotiation, TLS and proof; default 10 seconds.
The existing transport/SQL bounds remain, with at most 64 TLS starts per rolling second per listener.
Unknown accounts get keyed per-name synthetic credentials and the same terminal `28P01` proof failure;
no measured timing-resistance or comprehensive account-enumeration defense is claimed. BackendKeyData,
successful startup and queries are gated on proof. Tests generate certificates/keys in memory and
independently calculate client proofs. The proposal is [RFC 0007](../../docs/rfc/0007-pgwire-scram-tls-integration.md)
with [proposed ADR 0021](../../docs/adr/0021-pgwire-scram-tls-integration.md); security review and normal
comment period are pending. No production readiness, driver matrix or phase gate is established.
